# SUCCESS TIPS

1. **Consistency is key**: Code every day, even if just 2-3 hours
2. **Don't skip testing**: Test as you build, not at the end
3. **Ask for help**: Use Stack Overflow, Flutter docs, communities
4. **Start simple**: Don't over-engineer; make it work first, optimize later
5. **Take breaks**: Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break)
6. **Review code**: Spend 30 min weekly reviewing what you wrote
7. **Stay motivated**: Celebrate small wins, track progress visually
8. **Be flexible**: Adjust timeline if needed, some tasks may take longer
9. **Learn from errors**: Debug is learning, don't get frustrated
10. **Focus on MVP**: Complete core features before adding extras
